<h1>Milestone 1 : Clear Goal</h1>
<h2>Finalized Project Concept</h2>
<h3>
    <p>We defined the complete vision for the project:</p>
        <p>A browser-based dress-up SPA where users create outfits, save them,
            Publish them, and vote on each other's designs in real time.</p>
    
            <p>Week 1 was dedicated to defining exactly what we're building and
                what the final product should look like</p>
</h3>
