Project Name

Sparkle Style

One-Sentence Description

A simple browser-based dress-up game for children, where users style a single avatar, save their outfits privately, and optionally publish selected outfits to a public real-time voting room.

Project Summary

We will build a single-page web application with one static avatar and a curated set of clothing items. Users can assemble outfits by clicking items to apply or remove them. Outfits can be saved and loaded privately through basic persistent storage. If a user chooses, they can publish a selected outfit to a shared public voting room. The voting room displays only published outfits, each with LIKE/DISLIKE counters updated in real time through WebSockets.

Core Features

– Single static avatar
– Clothing set (tops, bottoms, shoes, etc.)
